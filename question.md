23–30: Advanced Core + Tricky Questions

What is a Constructor? Types of constructors? Can a constructor be private? (Singleton use-case).
Explain static keyword in detail (static variable, method, block, nested class).
What are Access Modifiers in Java? Give scope table for public, protected, default, private.
Explain Garbage Collection in Java (basic working, when it runs, System.gc()).
What are Wrapper Classes? Explain Autoboxing and Unboxing with example.
What is Singleton Class? Write code for a thread-safe Singleton (eager/lazy/double-checked).
What are Generics in Java? Why do we use them? Give one example.
Explain Composition vs Inheritance ("Has-A" vs "Is-A" relationship). Which is preferred and why?










30 Most Asked SQL Interview Questions for Technical Project Associate (TPA) Role at SalesCode.ai
SalesCode.ai TPA interviews (Glassdoor, AmbitionBox, Naukri & candidate reports 2024–2026) heavily test practical SQL for sales/transaction data pipelines, reporting, and CPG analytics (65+ brands, 1B+ records).
Expect 4–6 SQL questions in OA/MCQs + 2–3 live query writing + theory in technical rounds. Focus: Joins, GROUP BY + HAVING, 2nd highest/top-N, self-joins, indexing, normalization & ACID.
Here is the curated list of the 30 most frequently asked questions (ranked by frequency).
1–10: Basic SQL & Joins (Highest Weightage – 80% of rounds)

Write a query to find the 2nd highest salary from Employee table (classic – asked in almost every TPA round).
Difference between INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN and FULL OUTER JOIN? With examples.
Write a query using SELF JOIN to find manager names for each employee (Employee-Manager hierarchy – very common).
Write a query to find all employees who have no manager (NULL handling).
Difference between JOIN and UNION?
Write a query to get total sales amount by region (basic aggregation + join).
How do you handle NULL values in joins? (COALESCE, IS NULL).
Write a query using CROSS JOIN (cartesian product) – when is it used?
Explain Equi Join vs Non-Equi Join.
Write a query to find duplicate records in a Sales table.

11–18: GROUP BY, HAVING & Aggregations (Most Asked in Live Coding)

Explain GROUP BY + HAVING with a real example (e.g., departments with average salary > 50k).
Difference between WHERE and HAVING clause?
Write a query to find top 5 regions by total sales amount (GROUP BY + ORDER BY + LIMIT).
Write a query to find departments where average salary > overall average salary (subquery + GROUP BY).
Use aggregate functions: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX with GROUP BY.
How to find number of employees in each department who joined in 2024 (DATE functions).
Write a query to get monthly sales trend (GROUP BY month/year).
Explain ROLLUP and CUBE operators (sometimes asked in advanced rounds).

19–25: Subqueries, Window Functions & Advanced Queries

Write a query using correlated subquery to find employees earning more than their department average.
Difference between Subquery and Common Table Expression (CTE)? Write example of each.
Use RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), ROW_NUMBER() to find top 3 highest paid employees per department (Window functions – increasingly asked).
Write a query to find employees who are also managers (using window or self-join).
Use LAG() / LEAD() to show previous month sales comparison.
How to delete duplicate rows from a table (using ROW_NUMBER or self-join).
Write a query using EXISTS vs IN (performance difference).

26–30: Theory – Indexing, Normalization, ACID, Performance (Quick Theory – Always Asked)

What is Normalization? Explain 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF with example (sales/order schema).
What are Indexes? Types (Clustered vs Non-Clustered)? Advantages and disadvantages of indexing (asked in every Test/TPA round).

30 Most Asked DSA Interview Questions for Technical Project Associate (TPA) Role at SalesCode.ai
SalesCode.ai TPA interviews (Glassdoor + AmbitionBox reports Apr 2025 – Feb 2026) follow this exact pattern:

Online Assessment: 2 DSA coding questions (Easy–Medium) + Java MCQs
Pen-Paper Round: Write 2 DSA solutions on paper + explain time & space complexity (they watch you dry-run)

Focus: Arrays, Strings, HashMap, basic LinkedList/Stack + mandatory complexity explanation. Questions are standard LeetCode Easy/Medium but asked in sales-data context (e.g., sales amounts, product IDs, routes). Java implementation expected. No heavy DP/Graphs reported for TPA.
Here is the curated list of the 30 most frequently asked questions (ranked by frequency in TPA rounds).
1–12: Arrays & Strings (Highest Weightage – 70% of all DSA rounds)

Check if a string is a palindrome (ignore case/spaces sometimes).
Check if two strings are anagrams.
Find all duplicates in an array (return list or count).
Two Sum – find indices of two numbers that add up to target (HashMap approach mandatory).
Remove duplicates from a sorted array (in-place, return new length).
Find the second largest / second smallest element in an array.
Rotate an array by k steps (right/left).
Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (maximum profit – one transaction).

Intersection of two arrays (or common elements with frequency).
Contains Duplicate (return true if any value appears at least twice).
Group Anagrams (group strings that are anagrams).
Find the majority element (appears > n/2 times – Boyer-Moore or HashMap).
Count frequency of each element (sales by product ID example).

19–24: Linked List (Basic operations – very common in pen-paper)

Detect a cycle in linked list (Floyd’s tortoise-hare).
Find the middle of a linked list.
Remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
